### Minor Changes

- 46b0e0a: Initial release of modular HighLevel SDK packages

    This release introduces a completely modular architecture for the HighLevel SDK, giving you the flexibility to install only what you need:

    **Choose Your Bundle Size:** - API client only: ~800KB (68% smaller than the monolithic SDK) - With memory storage: ~850KB (66% smaller) - With MongoDB storage: ~1.8MB (28% smaller) - Full stack with webhooks: ~2.2MB (12% smaller)

    **Key Benefits:** - **Zero forced dependencies** - No more installing Express or MongoDB when you only need the API client - **Platform agnostic** - Works in Node.js, browsers, Deno, and edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge) - **ESM-first** - Modern module system with full TypeScript support - **Tree-shakeable** - Modern bundlers can optimize unused code - **Fully composable** - Mix and match packages based on your needs

    **Available Packages:** - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-core` - Core API client with 35+ resources - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage` - Storage interfaces for custom adapters - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage-memory` - In-memory storage for development and testing - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage-mongodb` - Production-ready MongoDB adapter - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-webhooks` - Framework-agnostic webhook utilities with Express adapter - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk` - Meta-package for backwards compatibility (includes everything)

    **Migration:** Existing users can continue using `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk` for a drop-in replacement, or migrate to individual packages for smaller bundles. See the migration guide in `/docs/sdk/` for detailed instructions.

    This modular approach follows modern best practices and gives you full control over your dependency graph and bundle size.
