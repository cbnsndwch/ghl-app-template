### Minor Changes

- 46b0e0a: Initial release of modular HighLevel SDK packages

    This release introduces a completely modular architecture for the HighLevel SDK, giving you the flexibility to install only what you need:

    **Choose Your Bundle Size:**
      - API client only: ~800KB (68% smaller than the monolithic SDK)
      - With memory storage: ~850KB (66% smaller)
      - With MongoDB storage: ~1.8MB (28% smaller)
      - Full stack with webhooks: ~2.2MB (12% smaller)

    **Key Benefits:**
      - **Zero forced dependencies** - No more installing Express or MongoDB when you only need the API client
      - **Platform agnostic** - Works in Node.js, browsers, Deno, and edge runtimes (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge)
      - **ESM-first** - Modern module system with full TypeScript support
      - **Tree-shakeable** - Modern bundlers can optimize unused code
      - **Fully composable** - Mix and match packages based on your needs

    **Available Packages:**
      - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-core` - Core API client with 35+ resources
      - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage` - Storage interfaces for custom adapters
      - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage-memory` - In-memory storage for development and testing
      - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-storage-mongodb` - Production-ready MongoDB adapter
      - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk-webhooks` - Framework-agnostic webhook utilities with Express adapter
      - `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk` - Meta-package for backwards compatibility (includes everything)

    **Migration:** Existing users can continue using `@cbnsndwch/ghl-sdk` for a drop-in replacement, or migrate to individual packages for smaller bundles. See the migration guide in `/docs/sdk/` for detailed instructions.

    This modular approach follows modern best practices and gives you full control over your dependency graph and bundle size.
